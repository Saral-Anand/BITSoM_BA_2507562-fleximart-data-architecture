Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end data architecture solution for FlexiMart, an e-commerce platform. The objective was to design and implement a complete data pipeline starting from raw CSV files to analytical reporting using both relational and NoSQL databases, and a data warehouse.

The project covers data ingestion, data cleaning, transformation, database modeling, NoSQL analysis, dimensional modeling, and OLAP-based analytics. It demonstrates practical understanding of ETL pipelines, relational database normalization, MongoDB document modeling, star schema design, and business intelligence queries.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main parts:

Part 1 – Database & ETL:
Python-based ETL pipeline to clean and load raw customer, product, and sales data into MySQL, along with schema documentation and business queries.

Part 2 – NoSQL Analysis:
Justification for using MongoDB and implementation of MongoDB operations on a flexible product catalog using document-based modeling.

Part 3 – Data Warehouse & Analytics:
Star schema design, warehouse implementation, sample data loading, and OLAP analytical queries for sales, product performance, and customer segmentation.
